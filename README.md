# Diseases Prediction System

## Project Overview
The Diseases Prediction System is a Machine Learning based application that predicts possible diseases based on user provided symptoms. The system uses training data to learn patterns and predict diseases accurately.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning, data processing, and prediction using Python.

## Key Features
- Predict diseases based on symptoms
- Machine learning based prediction
- Uses training and testing datasets
- Stores data using database
- Simple and easy to use
- Real-world healthcare prediction project

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SQLite Database

## How the System Works
1. Load training dataset
2. Train machine learning model
3. Accept symptoms as input
4. Predict disease based on trained model
5. Display predicted disease
6. Store or retrieve data from database if required
